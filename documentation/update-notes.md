# dwriter Update Notes

## Version 3.7.0 - April 6, 2026

### 🚀 Key Features

#### 1. 7-Day "Weekly Pulse" Wrap-up
- **Dynamic Metrics Engine**: Integrated advanced behavioral analytics into the core engine. Users are now categorized by **Archetypes** (e.g., "The Deep Diver", "The Closer") based on their rolling 7-day activity.
- **Peak Performance Visualization**: Automated identification of the user's **Golden Hour**, the time window of highest focus and task completion.
- **Momentum & Velocity**: Real-time tracking of task clearing rates compared to the previous week, providing a clear "Momentum Delta."
- **Project Spotlight**: Automated "Big Rock" detection that highlights which project consumed the majority of your bandwidth this week.

#### 2. Headless-First Weekly Summaries
- **`dwriter stats --weekly`**: A new high-signal terminal command that renders the Weekly Pulse wrap-up without launching the TUI.
- **`dwriter standup --weekly`**: Integrated weekly retrospective summaries into the standup generator, supporting multi-format export for Slack, Jira, and Markdown.

### 🛠 Improvements & Fixes
- **Dashboard Refinement**: Replaced the static "Two-Cents" insight box with the dynamic "7-Day Pulse" retrospective.
- **TUI Selector Hardening**: Implemented high-specificity CSS overrides for custom HUD elements to ensure visual consistency across different terminal themes.
- **Styling Harmonization**: Unified the "Quick Add" visual indicators across both the Logs and To-Do screens.

### ⚠️ Known Issues
- **Quick Add Vibrancy**: The `[+]` tab in the To-Do board may exhibit a slight color intensity mismatch compared to the Logs screen button in certain high-contrast themes due to internal Textual rendering logic.
